Simple API to generate common test cases for competitive programming problems.

It isn't very sophisticated - for example, it doesn't support writing to a file, and there are only a few types of cases - but it's good enough for me. I generally just print the output to the screen, copy it, and paste it into whatever text editor the site I'm using provides me with. I might make it more robust as I take part in more competitive programming challenges and events.
